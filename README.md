This repo contains random, non-related code that I use to test build scripts and the like.

The cURL file is meant to run from the command line and execute the different commands locally on your machine. The syntax is:

`curl path/to/github/file | sh`

For this file, the path is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimgafar/random_stuff/master/curlfile`
